# ✨SentiLog AI Project Code of Conduct✨

SentiLog AI is dedicated to providing a positive, respectful, and inclusive environment for all contributors, maintainers, and users. We have established this Code of Conduct to outline our expectations for behavior within our community. This code applies to all interactions within the project, including discussions, contributions, code reviews, issues, and community events.

## 🌟Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing sentiment analysis technology and mental health awareness.

## 🚦Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* 💖**Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* 🤝**Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* 📝**Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback on code, documentation, and ideas
* 🌱**Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* 🎯**Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and project goals
* 🧠**Supporting mental health awareness** and treating discussions about emotions and sentiment with sensitivity
* 🔍**Providing helpful code reviews** that focus on improvement rather than criticism
* 📚**Sharing knowledge** and helping newcomers understand the project structure and goals

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* 🛑**Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
* ⚠️**Public or private harassment** in any form
* 🔒**Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* 💔**Making light of mental health issues** or using mental health terminology inappropriately
* 🗑️**Submitting malicious code** or intentionally introducing vulnerabilities
* 📱**Spamming issues or pull requests** without meaningful contribution
* ❌**Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## 👨‍⚖️Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 🌐Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using the official project email address
* Posting via official social media accounts
* Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events
* Contributing to the SentiLog AI codebase across all three components (client/, server/, ml-api/)
* Participating in project discussions, issues, and pull request reviews


## 💻Technical Conduct Guidelines

In addition to general community standards, we expect:

* **Quality Contributions**: Submit well-tested, documented code that aligns with project goals
* **Respectful Code Reviews**: Focus on code improvement, not personal criticism
* **Accurate Documentation**: Provide clear, helpful documentation and commit messages
* **Security Awareness**: Report security vulnerabilities responsibly and privately
* **Attribution**: Properly credit sources and respect intellectual property rights
* **Performance Consideration**: Be mindful of computational resources, especially in ML model development


## 📋Pull Request and Issue Guidelines

All contributions, including pull requests and issues, must align with this Code of Conduct:

* **Constructive Communication**: Use respectful language in all PR descriptions, comments, and issue reports
* **Meaningful Contributions**: Ensure your contributions add value to the project
* **Proper Documentation**: Include clear descriptions of changes and their impact
* **Testing Requirements**: Submit tested code with appropriate test coverage
* **Mental Health Sensitivity**: When working with sentiment analysis features, approach the subject matter with appropriate care and sensitivity


## 🛡️Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [openml.stack@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## 📖Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. ✏️Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

* **Responsible Development**: Consider the ethical implications of sentiment analysis technology


## 🤝Community Support

We encourage community members to:

* **Help newcomers** understand the project structure and contribution process

* **Foster innovation** in sentiment analysis and mental health technology
